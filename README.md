# C-Compiler
I will be learning to create my own C compiler.

The compiler is made up of three parts: lexer, parser and code generator.
The lexer takes the file and performs a regex and creates a list of tokens.
The parser creates an abstract syntax tree (AST) from the list of tokens with the program as the root.
The code generator takes in the AST and creates the assembly code from it.
Pretty printing prints out the AST in a more readable way

Lexer:

Parser:

Code generator:
